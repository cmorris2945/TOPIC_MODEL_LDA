Checks for the full amounts owed were sent to each of these accounts from XXXX to Capital One : Capital One ending in # XXXX {$3700.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$680.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$2600.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$2100.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$3400.00} Total payment on these accounts : {$12000.00}. \\nPrior to these payoff checks sent, I made my monthly payments due XX/XX/XXXX to avoid any late fees while these checks were received and processed by Capital One. \\nI later received statements showing I owed interest on each one after payment in full was received. After sending them a letter priority mail on XX/XX/2020, asking why I was paying interest on top of interest, I received a letter on XX/XX/2020 letting me know the accounts were closed per my request, which I had requested they close since I was paying in full BUT no answer to my question. I attempted to call several times prior to mailing this letter but had not success in getting anyone on the line after waiting over an hour. I went ahead and paid the interest on these accounts which added to {$280.00}, out of fear I may be hit with a late fee. I attempted to call again XX/XX/2020. After waiting over an hour for a rep on phone, I was told I had to pay the interest on interest and also a residual fee after for each one. ( how do you pay interest on interest? ) Residual fee? On accounts paid in full? They said, that was their policy. \\nShortly after making full payments on these accounts, On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband lost his job due to COVID and is currently unemployed. I have struggled to pay these additional fees that I find to be an illegal act by this credit card company. I was told if I did not pay the additional fees, a late fee will be added on top. I should not have to pay interest or residual fees on a payoff amount that had not outstanding balance. I also requested a copy of their agreement stating they are allowed to do this. I never received a response or any response to any of my questions. Again, we are in no financial position at this time due to loss of unemployment to be slammed with extra fees. It is unfortunate that the timing on these payments made in full and my husband losing his job came at a worse time.</td>\n",

I soon deposited approximately {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX into the account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email update from Citibank about the offer and thanking me for enrolling in the Citibank {$200.00} checking offer and repeating the terms of the agreement. \\n\\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX I utilized the Citibank Mobile Application 's chat function to inquire as to when my bonus might be depositing, as it had been well over 60 days since when I opened the account and deposited the qualifying funds on XX/XX/XXXX. 60 days since my deposit would have been around early XX/XX/XXXX. The Mobile Application representative stated they could not resolve the issue and to call their One Stop Sales Unit, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative at the One Stop Sales Unit was confused and did not know how to search for the offer clearly, saying too that often the offers are for holding money in the account for 90 days or more, and provided essentially no clarity or guidance. \\n\\nI withdrew {$3000.00} of the {$5000.00} I had held in the account since XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, my first withdrawl from the account. I am concerned as Citibank has been very unclear on when my deposit bonus will be depositing, as that is {$5000.00} I could be storing in other accounts that actually provided material interest income ( which are generally well over 1.7 % at the moment compared to Citibank Basic Checking 's essential zero interest ). Furthermore Citibank makes it extremely difficult to get any clear, definite answers on the matter as neither their chat representative nor their One Stop Sales Unit personnel have any meaningful knowledge on how to handle the matter.</td>\n",

Checks for the full amounts owed were sent to each of these accounts from XXXX to Capital One : Capital One ending in # XXXX {$3700.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$680.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$2600.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$2100.00} Capital One ending in # XXXX {$3400.00} Total payment on these accounts : {$12000.00}. \\nPrior to these payoff checks sent, I made my monthly payments due XX/XX/XXXX to avoid any late fees while these checks were received and processed by Capital One. \\nI later received statements showing I owed interest on each one after payment in full was received. After sending them a letter priority mail on XX/XX/2020, asking why I was paying interest on top of interest, I received a letter on XX/XX/2020 letting me know the accounts were closed per my request, which I had requested they close since I was paying in full BUT no answer to my question. I attempted to call several times prior to mailing this letter but had not success in getting anyone on the line after waiting over an hour. I went ahead and paid the interest on these accounts which added to {$280.00}, out of fear I may be hit with a late fee. I attempted to call again XX/XX/2020. After waiting over an hour for a rep on phone, I was told I had to pay the interest on interest and also a residual fee after for each one. ( how do you pay interest on interest? ) Residual fee? On accounts paid in full? They said, that was their policy. \\nShortly after making full payments on these accounts, On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband lost his job due to COVID and is currently unemployed. I have struggled to pay these additional fees that I find to be an illegal act by this credit card company. I was told if I did not pay the additional fees, a late fee will be added on top. I should not have to pay interest or residual fees on a payoff amount that had not outstanding balance. I also requested a copy of their agreement stating they are allowed to do this. I never received a response or any response to any of my questions. Again, we are in no financial position at this time due to loss of unemployment to be slammed with extra fees. It is unfortunate that the timing on these payments made in full and my husband losing his job came at a worse time.  ...  CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n",
              "46281  On or about XX/XX/XXXX I opened a Citibank Basic Checking Account after seeing an offer described by Citibank that if I opened a Basic Checking Account, deposited at least {$5000.00} within 30 days of accounting opening, and held at least that amount in the account for 60 days that within 90 days after fulfilling the conditions of the agreement I would receive a {$200.00} checking account bonus. I soon deposited approximately {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX into the account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email update from Citibank about the offer and thanking me for enrolling in the Citibank {$200.00} checking offer and repeating the terms of the agreement. \\n\\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX I utilized the Citibank Mobile Application 's chat function to inquire as to when my bonus might be depositing, as it had been well over 60 days since when I opened the account and deposited the qualifying funds on XX/XX/XXXX. 60 days since my deposit would have been around early XX/XX/XXXX. The Mobile Application representative stated they could not resolve the issue and to call their One Stop Sales Unit, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative at the One Stop Sales Unit was confused and did not know how to search for the offer clearly, saying too that often the offers are for holding money in the account for 90 days or more, and provided essentially no clarity or guidance. \\n\\nI withdrew {$3000.00} of the {$5000.00} I had held in the account since XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, my first withdrawl from the account. I am concerned as Citibank has been very unclear on when my deposit bonus will be depositing, as that is {$5000.00} I could be storing in other accounts that actually provided material interest income ( which are generally well over 1.7 % at the moment compared to Citibank Basic Checking 's essential zero interest ). Furthermore Citibank makes it extremely difficult to get any clear, definite answers on the matter as neither their chat representative nor their One Stop Sales Unit personnel have any meaningful knowledge on how to handle the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                               ...

The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program.

For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.</td>\n",

Now it is back up to the high bank fees and interest charges that have again gone beyond what I can afford monthly the {$240.00}.

              "30060  I have a business checking account at BB & T. On XX/XX/2019, I attempted to deposit a check into my account and I received a message stating that I was over my monthly mobile deposit limit. I was confused because it was the first of the month and I had not deposited any checks since the previous month. I called BB & T and they said that I couldnt deposit checks into business accounts via the mobile app even though I had done that before. \\n\\nI was instructed to open a personal account, into which I could deposit checks via the mobile app. I was told that if I opened the account online I would have immediate access, that I could link my personal and business accounts, and immediately be able to transfer money between them. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened my personal account online. Though I successfully opened online, I did not have online access as I had been promised. Because I was traveling in an area where there were no BB & T branches, I could not go into a branch until XX/XX/2019. In the intervening time, my business account became overdrawn. I had the money in my personal account to bring it back into the black, but BB & T could not make the transfer until I went into a branch. During this time, I incurred an astonishing {$320.00} in overdraft fees in my business account because I had no way of transferring money between the two accounts. \\n\\nWhen I went into the branch, I met with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX County, Florida. She investigated the accounts and told me she would link them and that I would have online access in XXXX hours. The online access still never material, I was not able to transfer money and I received an additional {$36.00} overdraft fee. This brought the total to {$360.00} in overdraft fees. \\n\\nI had only opened the second account on BB & Ts advice ; I could have had my customer send a bank wire directly into business account in the first week of XXXX to keep the account positive. My TOTAL deposits between the two accounts was always positive. \\n\\nI requested a refund and was told they would not refund any of the fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ...

To my knowledge I didnt owe a payment because the account wasnt being used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ...

              "20993  I first applied for the Fedloan Serving program in XXXX in hopes of getting loan forgiveness since I've been paying on my student loans since late XXXX or early XXXX and I have been a public servant since XXXX, XXXX. I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.  ...  AES/PHEAA                        \n",
              "53     On several occasions ( XXXX ) I have tried to reach someone in costumer service today XX/XX/2020 I tried again to get through and was on hold for over 20 minutes and hung up. \\n\\n3 Years ago I have made no more than {$600.00} in purchases, and while making payments on my account with a {$9000.00} limit the interest charges are deducted from the credit limit and the interest was based on the balance each month. this left my interest and charge fess higher than my monthly payment which amounted to around {$240.00} each month. \\n\\nIn all of this time the interest was so big that it completely eat up the limit balance on the card, which left in me in a vicious cycle of never paying down the money owed. with in 2 years I was able to get the balance down {$2000.00} and I asked Walmart Capital One to reduce the balance down. Now it is back up to the high bank fees and interest charges that have again gone beyond what I can afford monthly the {$240.00}. This is a unfair and infantile game that is forced on me as an consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...
